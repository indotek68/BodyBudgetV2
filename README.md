Body Budget is a caloric management/ recipe-suggestion web application that integrates caloric and activity data received from a userâ€™s FitBit with caloric and nutritional data from a food recipe API (Yummly). Chart.js in conjunction with AJAX, for client-side API calls, was used for dynamic data visualization. The application was built with Rails backend framework and OmniAuth for Fitbit authorization and authentication.
